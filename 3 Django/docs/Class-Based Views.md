## Overview

The caveat with class-based views is that while they provide much for you, you must know how to customize them, they reflect the balance of convenience and control you find elsewhere in programming.

## Using Class-Based Views with Routing

There are two ways to use the built-in class-based views, either directly in the `urls.py` or by subclassing them. To create a route to a class-based view, you have to call `as_view()` and pass the result to `path`. The `DetailView` requires a `pk` in the path.

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views
app_name = 'myapp'
urlpatterns = [
    
    # function-based view
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
    path('<int:model_id>/', views.detail, name='detail'),
    
    # class-based view
    path('', views.IndexView.as_view(), name='index'),
    path('<int:pk>/', views.DetailView.as_view(), name='detail')
]
```

## Base Views

- [Base Views: View, TemplateView, RedirectView](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/class-based-views/base/)

### View

This the the base class of all other class-based views. It allows you to write a method to handle each HTTP method.

```python
# function-based view
def index(request):
    if request.method == 'GET':
        #...
    elif request.method == 'POST':
        #...

# class-based view
from django.views import View
class MyView(View):
    def get(self, request):
        #...
    def post(self, request):
        #...
```

### TemplateView

The `TemplateView` allows you to define a view just by specifying a template name and the data used to render it.

```python
from django.views.generic.base import TemplateView
from .models import MyModel
class MyView(TemplateView):
    template_name = "mytemplate.html"
    def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
        context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)
        context['my_model'] = MyModel.objects.all()
        return context
```

You can actually use a TemplateView without writing your own implementation.

```python
from django.views.generic.base import TemplateView
urlpatterns = [
    path('', TemplateView.as_view(template_name='index.html'), name="home"),
]
```


## Display Views

- [Display Views: DetailView,List View](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/class-based-views/generic-display/)

### ListView

A `ListView` 

The list of objects will default to the name `mymodel_list` in the template. You can customize this by setting `context_object_name` inside your view. You can also filter the data by overriding the `get_queryset` method.

The template used will default to `mymodel_list.html`. You can customize this by specifying a `template_name` inside your view.


```python
from django.views import generic
from .models import MyModel
class MyListView(generic.ListView):
    model = MyModel
    
    #below are default values you can change
    #context_object_name = 'mymodel_list'
    #template_name = 'myapp/mymodel_list.html'
    #def get_queryset(self):
    #    return MyModel.objects.all()
```



### DetailView

DetailView expects a 'pk' in the route: `path('<int:pk>/', views.DetailView.as_view(), name='detail')`.

The object's name will default to the name `mymodel` in the template. You can customize this by setting `context_object_name` inside your view.

The template used will default to `mymodel_detail.html`. You can customize this by specifying a `template_name` inside your view.


```python
from django.views import generic
from .models import MyModel
class MyDetailView(generic.DetailView):
    model = MyModel
    
    #below are default values you can change
    #context_object_name = 'mymodel'
    #template_name = 'myapp/mymodel_detail.html'
    #def get_object(self):
    #   object = super().get_object()
    #   return object
```
