Implement one of the following Python labs in a Flask app:

- [Rock, Paper, Scissors](../../1%20Python/labs/05%20Rock%20Paper%20Scissors.md)
  - Have the user choose rock, paper, or scissors, and show the user who won.
- [Rot Cipher](../../1%20Python/labs/11%20Rot%20Cipher.md)
  - Simple version: the user could just input the word to encode.
  - Complex version: the user could also input the amount to rotate by.
- [Unit Converter](../../1%20Python/labs/12%20Unit%20Converter.md)
  - Simple version: the user enters the distance and units and the app shows them the converted distance in meters
  - Complex version: the user also enters output units
- [Random Password Generator](../../1%20Python/labs/06%20Random%20Password%20Generator.md)
  - Simple version: the user just enters in the number of characters in the password
  - Complex version: the user enters the number of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters
- [Number to Phrase](../../1%20Python/mob/05%20Number%20to%20Phrase.md)
  - Have the user enter the number (5) and get back the corresponding word in english (five)
- [ARI](../../1%20Python/labs/14%20ARI.md)
  - Have the user enter in the URL for a Project Gutenberg book, load the book and show the ARI, grade level, etc.
