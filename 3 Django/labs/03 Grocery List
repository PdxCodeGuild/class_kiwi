Let's create a simple grocery list app

This can be done with a single app called grocery_list and the model called GroceryItem with contains a text description and a boolean representing
whether it was completed. 

The user should be presented with an input field and a button (in a form). When the user clicks the button, it should save the data to the server and show the
newly-added item in the list. The user should be presented with a list of incomplete items and a list of completed items. The user should be able to mark an item 
complete/incomplete and be able to delete an item.
