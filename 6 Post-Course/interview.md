# The Interview

If you're not offered the job, don't take it personally, and ask for feedback to better understand what you can do differently next time.

## Culture Questions

It's always good to have an elevator pitch ready to answer the inevitable "tell me about yourself": where you've come from, what you've experienced, where you are now, what you want, etc. Definitely try to convey that you've adopted a growth mentality and are ready to learn new things.

- How did you become interested in programming?
- What is your favourite programming language?
- What kind of technologies are you excited to learn more about?
- Can you tell us about a project you completed recently?
- What is something you have built that you are proud of?
- What is one of your weaknesses? (inexperience)
- Tell us about a time you had to explain something technical to a nontechnical person.
- Did you encounter any conflicts at your last job? How did you resolve them?
- What do you want to get from the coming years in your career?
