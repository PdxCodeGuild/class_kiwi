# Intro to Flask

Implement one of the following Python labs in a Flask app:

- [Rot Cipher](../../1%20Python/labs/11%20Rot%20Cipher.md)
  - Simple version: the user could just input the word to encode.
  - Complex version: the user could also input the amount to rotate by.
- [Unit Converter](../../1%20Python/labs/12%20Unit%20Converter.md)
  - Simple version: the user enters the distance and units and the app shows them the converted distance in meters
  - Complex version: the user also enters output units
- [Random Password Generator](../../1%20Python/labs/06%20Random%20Password%20Generator.md)
  - Simple version: the user just enters in the number of characters in the password
  - Complex version: the user enters the number of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters
