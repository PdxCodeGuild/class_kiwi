# Storefront

Let's build a landing page for a store front. Pick a type of product to sell and a color scheme.

## Part 1

- Add a header with a logo, site title, and nav
- Add some lorem ipsum for a company page
- Add a list of products (at least 3) with images and descriptions (use a [flexbox](../docs/10%20CSS%20Flexbox%20+%20Grid.md))
- Add a footer with a copyright

## Part 2

- Make all the content centered
- Make sure the page looks okay on mobile
- Add an effect when you hover over the links in the nav
- Add an effect when you hover over the products
