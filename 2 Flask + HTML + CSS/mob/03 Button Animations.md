# Button Animations

Let's try re-creating some CSS animations.

- Go to [this pen](https://codepen.io/flux2341/pen/rNyOLMj?editors=1100) and fork it (the 'fork' button is in the top right corner).
- Go [here](https://codepen.io/Chelsea-Dover/full/ygNwej/) and in your pen match the animations. You don't have to worry about the colors being different. Just focus on the effects.
