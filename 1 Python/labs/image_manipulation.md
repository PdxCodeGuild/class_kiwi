# Lab 16: Image Manipulation

Let's convert an image into greyscale using the Pillow library, which is a fork of PIL 'python image library'. First download the file from [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7d/Lenna_%28test_image%29.png) and place it in the same directory as your code (or save it anywhere and use an absolute path when opening it). If you don't have pillow installed, run `pip install pillow` in a terminal. You can check if pillow using `pip show pillow`.

Use the formula for converting to greyscale and the code below. Remember that Pillow uses `ints` for RGB values, in the range of 0-255, whereas your math will often use `floats`. 'Y' is used to represent the brightness. The following formula get the brightness of an RGB triplet. To convert to greyscale, set R, G, and B to Y.

`Y = 0.299*R + 0.587*G + 0.114*B`

```python
from PIL import Image
img = Image.open("lenna.png") # must be in same folder
width, height = img.size
pixels = img.load()

for i in range(width):
    for j in range(height):
        r, g, b = pixels[i, j]

        # your code here

        pixels[i, j] = (r, g, b)

img.show()

```



## Version 2

Use the `colorsys` library to increase the saturation, decrease the brightness, and rotate the hue. Colorsys represents colors as floats in the range 0.0 - 1.0, whereas pillow uses ints in the range 0 - 255. You'll have to convert between these two representations.

```python
import colorsys

# colorsys uses colors in the range [0, 1]
h, s, v = colorsys.rgb_to_hsv(r/255, g/255, b/255)

# do some math on h, s, v

r, g, b = colorsys.hsv_to_rgb(h, s, v)

# convert back to [0, 255]

r = int(r*255)
g = int(g*255)
b = int(b*255)
```

## Version 3

Pillow can also be used to draw, the code below demonstrates some functions that Pillow provides. Use these functions to draw a stick figure. You can find more documentation [here](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/4.2.x/reference/ImageDraw.html).

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw

width = 500
height = 500

img = Image.new('RGB', (width, height))

draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)


# the origin (0, 0) is at the top-left corner

draw.rectangle(((0, 0), (width, height)), fill="white")

# draw a rectangle from x0, y0 to x1, y1
draw.rectangle(((100, 100), (300, 300)), fill="lightblue")

# draw a line from x0, y0, x1, y1
# using the color pink
color = (256, 128, 128)  # pink
draw.line((0, 0, width, height), fill=color)
draw.line((0, height, width, 0), fill=color)


circle_x = width/2
circle_y = height/2
circle_radius = 100
draw.ellipse((circle_x-circle_radius, circle_y-circle_radius, circle_x+circle_radius, circle_y+circle_radius), fill='lightgreen')

img.show()
```

Try running the code below, which generates 1000 random lines with random colors.

```python

from PIL import Image, ImageDraw
from random import randint

width = 500
height = 500

img = Image.new('RGB', (width, height))
draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)

for i in range(1000):
    x0 = randint(0, width)
    y0 = randint(0, height)
    x1 = randint(0, width)
    y1 = randint(0, height)
    line_width = randint(1, 40)
    red = randint(0, 255)
    green = randint(0, 255)
    blue = randint(0, 255)
    draw.line((x0, y0, x1, y1), fill=(red, green, blue), width=line_width)

img.show()
```
