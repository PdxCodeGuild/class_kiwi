# Lab 7: Rock Paper Scissors

Let's play rock-paper-scissors with the computer.

1. The computer will ask the user for their choice (rock, paper, scissors)
2. The computer will randomly choose rock, paper or scissors
3. Determine who won and tell the user

Let's list all the cases:
- rock vs rock (tie)
- rock vs paper
- rock vs scissors
- paper vs rock
- paper vs paper
- paper vs scissors
- scissors vs rock
- scissors vs paper
- scissors vs scissors

## Version 2 (optional)

After playing, ask them if they'd like to play again. If they say yes, restart the game, otherwise exit.
