# Mini Capstone

For your final Python project, build a program that solves a problem or accomplishes a task. Your program needs to utilize an external library (not part of the Python standard library -- this needs to be something that you `pip install`).  

The functionality of the program is up to you -- use this as an opportunity to get creative. Sometimes students explore an idea they want to use for their capstone project or solve an actual problem they have. For a list of Python libraries to consider using in this project, check out https://awesome-python.com
