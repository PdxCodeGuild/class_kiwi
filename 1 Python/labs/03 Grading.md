# Grading

## Part 1

Let's convert a number grade to a letter grade, using `if` and `elif` statements and comparisons. First have the user enter a number representing the grade (0-100). Then convert the number grade to a letter grade.

Concepts Covered:
- `fundamentals`, `comparisons & conditionals`


Numeric Ranges:
- 90-100: A
- 80-89: B
- 70-79: C
- 60-69: D
- 0-59: F


## Part 2

Find the specific letter grade (A+, B-, etc). You can check for more specific ranges using `if` statements, or use modulus `%` to get the ones-digit to set another string to `'+'`, `'-'`, or `' '`. Then you can concatenate that string with your grade string.
