# Lab 3: Number to Phrase

Convert a given number into its english representation. For example: 67 becomes 'sixty-seven'. Handle numbers from 0-99.

Hint: you can use modulus to extract the ones and tens digit.

```python
x = 67
tens_digit = x//10
ones_digit = x%10
```
Hint 2: use the digit as an index for a list of strings OR as a key for a dict of digit:phrase pairs.

## Version 2

Handle numbers from 100-999.

## Version 3 (optional)

Convert a number to roman numerals.

## Version 4 (optional)

Convert a time given in hours and minutes to a phrase.
