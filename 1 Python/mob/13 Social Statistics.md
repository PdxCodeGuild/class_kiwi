# Social Statistics

Let's write a Python program to derive some statistics from a dataset of social media posts and comments.


## Part 1

Find the most upvoted post.

Show which user had the most upvotes.


## Part 2 (optional)

Part 2 involves working with the comments, which have a nested structure.

```json
{
    "post": {
        "text": "Lorem Ipsum",
        "comments": [{
            "text": "Lorem Ipsum",
            "comments": [{
                "text": "Lorem Ipsum",
                "comments": []
            },{
                "text": "Lorem Ipsum",
                "comments": []
            }]
        }]
    }
}
```


Find the most upvoted comment
