            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Batman is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created 
            by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and debuted in the 27th issue of the comic book Detective Comics on 
            March 30, 1939. In the DC Universe continuity, Batman is the alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, 
            philanthropist, and industrialist who resides in Gotham City. Batman's origin story features him swearing vengeance 
            against criminals after witnessing the murder of his parents Thomas and Martha, a vendetta tempered with the ideal of justice. 
            He trains himself physically and intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired persona, and monitors the Gotham streets at night. 
            Kane, Finger, and other creators accompanied Batman with supporting characters, including his sidekicks Robin and Batgirl; allies 
            Alfred Pennyworth, James Gordon, and Catwoman; and foes such as the Penguin, the Riddler, Two-Face, and his archenemy the Joker.
            Kane conceived Batman in early 1939 to capitalize on the popularity of DC's Superman; although Kane frequently claimed sole creation 
            credit, Finger substantially developed the concept from a generic superhero into something more bat-like. The character received his 
            own spin-off publication, Batman, in 1940. Batman was originally introduced as a ruthless vigilante who frequently killed or maimed 
            criminals, but evolved into a character with a stringent moral code and strong sense of justice. Unlike most superheroes, Batman 
            does not possess any superpowers, instead relying on his intellect, fighting skills, and wealth. The 1960s Batman television series
            used a camp aesthetic, which continued to be associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators 
            worked to return the character to his darker roots in the 1970s and 1980s, culminating with the 1986 miniseries The Dark 
            Knight Returns by Frank Miller.

            DC has featured Batman in many comic books, including comics published under its imprints such as Vertigo and Black Label. 
            The longest-running Batman comic, Detective Comics, is the longest-running comic book in the United States. Batman is frequently 
            depicted alongside other DC superheroes, such as Superman and Wonder Woman, as a member of organizations such as the Justice 
            League and the Outsiders. In addition to Bruce Wayne, other characters have taken on the Batman persona on different occasions, 
            such as Jean-Paul Valley / Azrael in the 1993–1994 "Knightfall" story arc; Dick Grayson, the first Robin, from 2009 to 2011; 
            and Jace Fox, son of Wayne's ally Lucius, as of 2021.[4] DC has also published comics featuring alternate versions of Batman, 
            including the incarnation seen in The Dark Knight Returns and its successors, the incarnation from the Flashpoint (2011) event,
            and numerous interpretations from Elseworlds stories.
            
            One of the most iconic characters in popular culture, Batman has been listed among the greatest comic book superheroes and 
            fictional characters ever created. He is one of the most commercially successful superheroes, and his likeness has been licensed 
            and featured in various media and merchandise sold around the world; this includes toy lines such as Lego Batman and video games 
            like the Batman: Arkham series. Batman has been adapted in live-action and animated incarnations, including the 1960s Batman 
            television series played by Adam West and in film by Michael Keaton in Batman (1989), Batman Returns (1992) and The Flash (2022), 
            Christian Bale in The Dark Knight trilogy (2005–2012), Ben Affleck in the DC Extended Universe (2016–present), and Robert Pattinson 
            in The Batman (2022). Kevin Conroy, Jason O'Mara, and Will Arnett, among others, have provided the character's voice.
