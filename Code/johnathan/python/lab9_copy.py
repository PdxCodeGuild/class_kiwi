# # Lab 9: Compute Automated Readability Index

# Compute the ARI for a given body of text loaded in from a file. 
# The automated readability index (ARI) is a formula for computing the U.S. grade level for a given block of text. 
# The general formula to compute the ARI is as follows:

# ![ARI Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/878d1640d23781351133cad73bdf27bdf8bfe2fd)

# The score is computed by multiplying the number of characters* divided by the number of words* by 4.71,
# adding the number of words divided by the number of sentences multiplied by 0.5, and subtracting 21.43. 
# **If the result is a decimal, always round up.** Scores greater than 14 should be presented as having the same age 
# and grade level as scores of 14.

# Scores correspond to the following ages and grad levels:

# ```
#     Score  Ages     Grade Level
#      1       5-6    Kindergarten
#      2       6-7    First Grade
#      3       7-8    Second Grade
#      4       8-9    Third Grade
#      5      9-10    Fourth Grade
#      6     10-11    Fifth Grade
#      7     11-12    Sixth Grade
#      8     12-13    Seventh Grade
#      9     13-14    Eighth Grade
#     10     14-15    Ninth Grade
#     11     15-16    Tenth Grade
#     12     16-17    Eleventh grade
#     13     17-18    Twelfth grade
#     14     18-22    College
# ```

# Once youâ€™ve computed the ARI score, you can use the following dictionary to look up the age range and grade level.


# ari_scale = {
#      1: {'ages':   '5-6', 'grade_level': 'Kindergarten'},
#      2: {'ages':   '6-7', 'grade_level':    '1st Grade'},
#      3: {'ages':   '7-8', 'grade_level':    '2nd Grade'},
#      4: {'ages':   '8-9', 'grade_level':    '3rd Grade'},
#      5: {'ages':  '9-10', 'grade_level':    '4th Grade'},
#      6: {'ages': '10-11', 'grade_level':    '5th Grade'},
#      7: {'ages': '11-12', 'grade_level':    '6th Grade'},
#      8: {'ages': '12-13', 'grade_level':    '7th Grade'},
#      9: {'ages': '13-14', 'grade_level':    '8th Grade'},
#     10: {'ages': '14-15', 'grade_level':    '9th Grade'},
#     11: {'ages': '15-16', 'grade_level':   '10th Grade'},
#     12: {'ages': '16-17', 'grade_level':   '11th Grade'},
#     13: {'ages': '17-18', 'grade_level':   '12th Grade'},
#     14: {'ages': '18-22', 'grade_level':      'College'}
# }
# ```

# The output should look something like the following:

#     --------------------------------------------------------

#     The ARI for gettysburg-address.txt is 12
#     This corresponds to a 11th Grade level of difficulty
#     that is suitable for an average person 16-17 years old.
