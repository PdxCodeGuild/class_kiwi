    <!-- A written introduction | Center the entire content of the body -->

    <p> Lord Tyrion Lannister, also known by the nicknames the Halfman or the Imp and 
    the alias Hugor Hill, is a fictional character in the A Song of Ice and Fire series 
    of epic fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin, and its television 
    adaptation Game of Thrones, where he is portrayed by American actor Peter Dinklage. 
    Introduced in A Game of Thrones (1996), Tyrion is a prominent point of view character 
    in the series, having the most viewpoint chapters in the first five published novels.
    He is one of a few prominent characters not included in A Feast for Crows (2005) but 
    returned in A Dance with Dragons (2011), and is confirmed to appear in the forthcoming 
    sixth novel The Winds of Winter. Tyrion developed from a character concept Martin 
    had while writing the 1981 novel Windhaven. He is Martin's favorite character in the 
    series.
