Proposal: 
Create a website scraper to clone websites for offensive security personnel to use as phishing sites to lure victims into entering their real credentials into a cloned website.

I plan to use website scraper APIs to clone a real site and be able to start the site and use it for phishing campaigns.

To-Do:
1. Write code in python to to test API functionality
2. Set-up Django back-end
3. Convert python code into Django compatible code
4. Set-up HTML front-end
    a. Create input field for user to enter url to clone
    b. Create input filed for user to enter number of levels to clone
    c. *Create Status Indicator
    d. Create button to start cloned website
    e. *Create pass-through to pass credentials to real url
