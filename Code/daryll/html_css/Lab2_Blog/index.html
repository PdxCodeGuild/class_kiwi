                <h2>What is Cyber Threat Intelligence?</h2>
                <h3>By: Intel & Analysis Working Group</h3>
                <br>
                This blog is the first of several by the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center’s (MS-ISAC)
                Intel & Analysis Working Group (I&AWG) on Cyber Threat Intelligence and intelligence analysis. Starting
                with this blog we will explore what is cyber threat intelligence, and examine what it is used for, its
                value to MS-ISAC members, the difficulties inherent in developing cyber threat intelligence, and the
                varying components of intelligence, such as Words of Estimative Probability.
                <br>
                <br>
                Cyber threat intelligence is what cyber threat information becomes once it has been collected, evaluated
                in the context of its source and reliability, and analyzed through rigorous and structured tradecraft
                techniques by those with substantive expertise and access to all-source information. Like all
                intelligence, cyber threat intelligence provides a value-add to cyber threat information, which reduces
                uncertainty for the consumer, while aiding the consumer in identifying threats and opportunities. It
                requires that analysts identify similarities and differences in vast quantities of information and
                detect deceptions to produce accurate, timely, and relevant intelligence.
                <br>
                <br>
                Rather than being developed in an end-to-end process, the development of intelligence is a circular
                process, referred to as the intelligence cycle. In this cycle requirements are stated; data collection
                is planned, implemented, and evaluated; the results are analyzed to produce intelligence; and the
                resulting intelligence is disseminated and re-evaluated in the context of new information and consumer
                feedback. The analysis portion of the cycle is what differentiates intelligence from information
                gathering and dissemination. Intelligence analysis relies on a rigorous way of thinking that uses
                structured analytical techniques to ensure biases, mindsets, and uncertainties are identified and
                managed. Instead of just reaching conclusions about difficult questions, intelligence analysts think
                about how they reach the conclusions. This extra step ensures that, to the extent feasible, the
                analysts’ mindsets and biases are accounted for and minimized or incorporated as necessary.
                <br>
                <br>
                The process is a cycle because it identifies intelligence gaps, unanswered questions, which prompt new
                collection requirements, thus restarting the intelligence cycle. Intelligence analysts identify
                intelligence gaps during the analysis phase. Intelligence analysts and consumers determine intelligence
                gaps during the dissemination and re-evaluation phase.
                <br>
                <br>
                For instance, MS-ISAC has a collection requirement to identify SLTT government website defacements so
                that we can notify the affected entity. To fulfill this requirement, MS-ISAC uses a process to identify
                and collect information on defaced SLTT government websites. In Quarter 2, evaluation of the MS-ISAC
                information identified an increase trend in defacements, and further analysis identified that the trend
                was due to an increase in printer server defacements. This analysis resulted in the identification of
                intelligence gaps: who were the actors defacing the printer servers? are they working together? are they
                exploiting a specific vulnerability? MS-ISAC published the current intelligence to warn members about
                the increase and initiated new requirements and collection efforts to fulfill the intelligence gaps.
                That new information was analyzed and turned into a series of publications providing additional
                intelligence on this trend.
                <br>
                <br>
                In cyber threat intelligence, analysis often hinges on the triad of actors, intent, and capability, with
                consideration given to their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), motivations, and access to the
                intended targets. By studying this triad it is often possible to make informed, forward-leaning
                strategic, operational, and tactical assessments.
                <ul>
                    <li>Strategic intelligence assesses disparate bits of information to form integrated views. It
                        informs decision and policy makers on broad or long-term issues and/or provides a timely warning
                        of threats. Strategic cyber threat intelligence forms an overall picture of the intent and
                        capabilities of malicious cyber threats, including the actors, tools, and TTPs, through the
                        identification of trends, patterns, and emerging threats and risks, in order to inform decision
                        and policy makers or to provide timely warnings.</li>
                    <li>Operational intelligence assesses specific, potential incidents related to events,
                        investigations, and/or activities, and provides insights that can guide and support response
                        operations. Operational or technical cyber threat intelligence provides highly specialized,
                        technically-focused, intelligence to guide and support the response to specific incidents; such
                        intelligence is often related to campaigns, malware, and/or tools, and may come in the form of
                        forensic reports.</li>
                    <li>Tactical intelligence assesses real-time events, investigations, and/or activities, and provides
                        day-to-day operational support. Tactical cyber threat intelligence provides support for
                        day-to-day operations and events, such as the development of signatures and indicators of
                        compromise (IOC). It often involves limited application of traditional intelligence analysis
                        techniques.</li>
                    <br>
                </ul>
                Cyber threat intelligence has proved beneficial to every level of state, local, tribal, and territorial
                (SLTT) government entities from senior executives, such as Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs),
                police chiefs, and policy makers, to those in the field, such as information technology specialists and
                law enforcement officers. In addition, it provides value for other experts as well, such as security
                officers, accountants, and terrorism and criminal analysts. Properly applied cyber threat intelligence
                can provide greater insight into cyber threats, allowing for a faster, more targeted response as well as
                resource development and allocation. For instance, it can assist decision makers in determining
                acceptable business risks, developing controls and budgets, in making equipment and staffing decisions
                (strategic intelligence), provide insights that guide and support incident response and post-incident
                activities (operational/technical intelligence), and advance the use of indicators by validating,
                prioritizing, specifying the length of time an indicator is valid (tactical intelligence). Over the next
                several years the inclusion of cyber threat intelligence into SLTT government operations will become
                increasingly important, as all levels and employees are forced to respond to the cyber threat.

                <h2>What is Proactive Threat Hunting?</h2>
                <h3>By: Scott Taschler</h3>
                <br>
                Threat hunting is the practice of proactively searching for cyber threats that are lurking undetected in
                a network. Cyber threat hunting digs deep to find malicious actors in your environment that have slipped
                past your initial endpoint security defenses.
                <br>
                <br>
                After sneaking in, an attacker can stealthily remain in a network for months as they quietly collect
                data, look for confidential material, or obtain login credentials that will allow them to move laterally
                across the environment.
                <br>
                <br>
                Once an adversary is successful in evading detection and an attack has penetrated an organization’s
                defenses, many organizations lack the advanced detection capabilities needed to stop the advanced
                persistent threats from remaining in the network. That’s why threat hunting is an essential component of
                any defense strategy.

                <h2>What is Incident Response?</h2>
                <h3>By: Cynet</h3>
                <br>
                Incident response (IR) is a set of information security policies and procedures that you can use to
                identify, contain, and eliminate cyberattacks. The goal of incident response is to enable an
                organization to quickly detect and halt attacks, minimizing damage and preventing future attacks of the
                same type.
                <br>
                <h3>Incident Response Steps: 6 Phases of the Incident Response Lifecycle</h3>
                There are six steps to incident response. These six steps occur in a cycle each time an incident occurs.
                The steps are:
                <ol>
                    <li>Preparation of systems and procedures</li>
                    <li>Identification of incidents</li>
                    <li>Containment of attackers and incident activity</li>
                    <li>Eradication of attackers and re-entry options</li>
                    <li>Recovery from incidents, including restoration of systems</li>
                    <li>Lessons learned and application of feedback to the next round of preparation</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Preparation</h3>
                <br>
                During your first preparation phase, you review existing security measures and policies to determine
                effectiveness. This involves performing a risk assessment to determine what vulnerabilities currently
                exist and the priority of your assets. Information is then applied to prioritizing responses for
                incident types. It is also used, if possible, to reconfigure systems to cover vulnerabilities and focus
                protection on high-priority assets.
                <br>
                This phase is where you refine existing policies and procedures or write new ones if you are lacking.
                These procedures include a communication plan and assignment of roles and responsibilities during an
                incident.
                <br>
                <h3>Identification of threats</h3>
                <br>
                Using the tools and procedures determined in the preparation phase, teams work to detect and identify
                any suspicious activity. When an incident is detected, team members need to work to identify the nature
                of the attack, its source, and the goals of the attacker.
                <br>
                During identification, any evidence collected needs to be protected and retained for later in-depth
                analysis. Responders should document all steps taken and evidence found, including all details. This can
                help you more effectively prosecute if an attacker is identified.
                <br>
                During this phase, after an incident is confirmed, communication plans are also typically initiated.
                These plans inform security members, stakeholders, authorities, legal counsel, and eventually users of
                the incident and what steps need to be taken.
                <br>
                <h3>Containment of threats</h3>
                <br>
                After an incident is identified, containment methods are determined and enacted. The goal is to advance
                to this stage as quickly as possible to minimize the amount of damage caused.
                <br>
                Containment is often accomplished in sub-phases:
                <br>
                Short term containment—immediate threats are isolated in place. For example, the area of your network
                that an attacker is currently in may be segmented off. Or, a server that is infected may be taken
                offline and traffic redirected to a failover.
                Long term containment—additional access controls are applied to unaffected systems. Meanwhile, clean,
                patched versions of systems and resources are created and prepared for the recovery phase.
                Elimination of threats
                <br>
                During and after containment, the full extent of an attack is made visible. Once teams are aware of all
                affected systems and resources, they can begin ejecting attackers and eliminating malware from systems.
                This phase continues until all traces of the attack are removed. In some cases, this may require taking
                systems off-line so assets can be replaced with clean versions in recovery.
                <br>
                <h3>Recovery and restoration</h3>
                <br>
                In this phase, teams bring updated replacement systems online. Ideally, systems can be restored without
                loss of data but this isn’t always possible.
                <br>
                In the latter case, teams must determine when the last clean copy of data was created and restore from
                it. The recovery phase typically extends for a while as it also includes monitoring systems for a while
                after an incident to ensure that attackers don’t return.
                <br>
                <h3>Feedback and refinement</h3>
                <br>
                The lessons learned phase is one in which your team reviews what steps were taken during a response.
                Members should address what went well, what didn’t, and make suggestions for future improvements. Any
                incomplete documentation should also be wrapped up in this phase.
            </div>
