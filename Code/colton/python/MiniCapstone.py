# For your final Python project, build a program that solves a problem or accomplishes a task. 
# Your program needs to utilize an external library (not part of the Python standard library -- 
# this needs to be something that you pip install).

# The functionality of the program is up to you -- use this as an opportunity to get creative. 
# Sometimes students explore an idea they want to use for their capstone project or solve an actual 
# problem they have. For a list of Python libraries to consider using in this project,
