                During the rainy season, many mushroom lovers head to BLM land or national forests to collect 
                wild mushrooms sprouting from the forest floor. Mycologist David Arora, author of "Mushrooms Demystified", 
                "All That the Rain Promises, and More ...," and "Economic Botany - The Mushroom Edition" has moved from the city to a  ridge outside Gualala, 
                above the southern Mendocino County coast.

            <div class="something">Arora developed a strong understanding of wild mushrooms when he was a kid in his home town of Pasadena. 
                Often times he would show up at his home after a day in the mountains with a basket of mushrooms and his dog with a turtle in its mouth.
