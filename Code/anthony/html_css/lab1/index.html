    <h1>Kobe Bryant</h1>
    <p>
      Kobe Bryant, in full Kobe Bean Bryant, (born August 23, 1978,
      Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died January 26, 2020, Calabasas,
      California), American professional basketball player, who helped lead the
      Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) to five
      championships (2000–02 and 2009–10). Bryant’s father, Joe (“Jelly Bean”)
      Bryant, was a professional basketball player who spent eight seasons in
      the NBA and eight more playing in Italy, where Bryant went to school. When
      his family returned to the United States, Bryant played basketball at
      Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, where he received
      several national Player of the Year awards and broke the southeastern
      Pennsylvania scoring record set by Wilt Chamberlain with 2,883 points.
      Bryant opted to forgo college and declared himself eligible for the NBA
      draft when he graduated from high school. The Charlotte Hornets chose him
      with the 13th pick of the 1996 draft. He was traded to the Lakers shortly
      thereafter and became the second youngest NBA player in history when the
      1996–97 season opened. He quickly proved his merit with the Lakers and was
      selected for the NBA All-Star Game in just his second season, becoming the
      youngest All-Star.
