<h1 align="center">Introduction</h1>
<q>Karl Marx (1818–1883) is often treated as a revolutionary, an activist rather than a philosopher,
    whose works inspired the foundation of many communist regimes in the twentieth century. It is
    certainly hard to find many thinkers who can be said to have had comparable influence in the
    creation of the modern world. However, Marx was trained as a philosopher, and although often portrayed
    as moving away from philosophy in his mid-twenties—perhaps towards history and the social sciences—there
    are many points of contact with modern philosophical debates throughout his writings.</q><a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
