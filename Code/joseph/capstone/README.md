Access your console Black Desert Online[^1][^2] in-game marketplace from anywhere
## Project Overview
An app to manage your inventory and grow your in-game wealth.  You will be able to plan, buy and sell player crafted items.  I will be using the [Velia Inn BDO API](https://developers.veliainn.com/) to create an app that will allow realtime access to the "Console Only" version of the marketplace, a vastly underserved market.  The user will be able to search for an item and see details like the current price, current trade volume and how many buy and sell orders are outstanding.
## Features
Easy to use responsive front end
# You will be able to
- Click and see every section and subsection available in-game
- Search for specific items without knowing what section or subsection they fall into
- Create a "watchlist" of items and save it for quick access
# If you elect to login using your Console BDO account
- You will be able to buy and sell directly from the app
- You can manage your in-game inventory warehouse
- Instantly respond to real-time market changes
