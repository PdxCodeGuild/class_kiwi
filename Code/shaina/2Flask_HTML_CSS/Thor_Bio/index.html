    <intro>
        Thor Odinson, more commonly known as Thor, and sometimes by his title 
        as the God of Thunder, based on the Marvel Comics character of the same 
        name and the Norse mythological god of the same name. In the MCU, he is 
        depicted as one of the most powerful Asgardians, an ancient alien 
        civilization with long ties to Earth, who humans consider to be gods. 
        Thor wields a powerful hammer called Mjolnir, well for awhile, and is 
        initially depicted as the arrogant heir to the throne of Asgard whose 
        brash behaviors causes turmoil among the Nine Realms under Asgard's 
        protection. This brings him into conflict with his villainous adopted 
        brother, Loki. Thor commits himself to the protection of Earth, and 
        becomes a founding member of the Avengers. Thor eventually becomes the 
        King of Asgard after Odin's death, you were warned of spoilers, but the 
        entire realm is destroyed during Ragnarök. Following the Blip, he passes the crown of New Asgard 
        to Valkyrie and joins the Guardians of the Galaxy.

        Thor is from the realm, Asgard, but due to various events, winds up living 
        in others. Particularly between Asgard and Midgard, A.K.A Earth. Due 
        to one circumstance or another he spends much time between the two, especially 
        with an evil step-brother, who REALLY wants to rule Earth for some reason. He 
        has resided in other locations as well, admittedly mostly involuntarily. A 
        well rounded list of places he has called "home" is below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Asgard</li>
        <li>Midgard (Earth)</li>
        <li>Asgard</li>
        <li>Back to Midgard (Earth)...... Let's just note this dance is done MANY more times.</li>
        <li>Asgard</li>
        <li>Sakaar....Good news, no more Asgard. Bad news no more Asgard to go back to period, also Sakaar was very much involuntary.</li>
        <li>Tensberg, Norway ... A.K.A. New Asgard ... B.K.A. Midgard (Earth)</li>
        <li>The Galaxy ... Joins the Guardians of the Galaxy and tours, well, the galaxy.</li>
      </ul>

        Much happens and "much" is an understatement! Some highlights include 
        saving Earth MANY TIMES. Thor finding love, saving love, and saving love 
        again. Battling his step-brother, saving his step-brother, oddly enough, 
        this is also a reoccurance. There's a haircut situation, a lost eye event, 
        by his own sister to add to the injury. Yeah, she came out of nowhere. There's
        a lost home sitch, a lost hammer sitch, and a major lost battle which 
        resulted in half the UNIVERSE just no longer existing.... you know what .... 
        thor goes through a serious period of lost. Which make the unexpected 
        "snap", see what I did there, more understandable (Nothing too crazy, he 
        just chops a head off. On the bright side, the head belonged to the bad 
        guy and he has a shiny new weapon). He then goes on a five year hiatus, 
        and in this new home of New Asgard, he resorts to heavy drnking and eating,
        which eventually results in lost of his muscular physique, which gives us 
        Bro Thor, who I find to be awesome. He does eventually snap out of it and
        returns to himself, but man it's a journey. To read about that journey
