# Project Overview
This project is to create a more user friendly interface to help veterans access much needed resources and forms which are hard to locate/obtain
by the VA website.
Due to a lack of needed funding the VA website is currently plagued with old/outdated pages and resources. There are many resources available to veterans for various
needs which are either inaccessible through the VA website or are convoluted making access to the resources incredibly difficult. 
In this project I will be utilizing the Django framework to verify veterans, spouses, and active members of the armed forces and help them gain access to forms, programs, job opportunities
and other resources created to honor their sacrifices. 
-- include user profile to let user know what they qualify for based on when separated
