# Project Overview
This project is designed to assist end users with researching companies of interest by consolidating databases and municipalities that contain their company records. 
In order to access information pertaining to companies of interest that do not have websites, often it is necessary to research them through the BBB(Better Business Bureau), contact the Department of Consumer Affairs, contact city hall, or attempt to find them through another public database. 
This project is designed to consolidate known databases and provide links for municipalities that hold public company information for easy access to the end user.
