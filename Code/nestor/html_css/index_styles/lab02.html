            A Cunucu dog originates from Aruba and while not officially recognized as a breed by any association or kennel club, they are well-known to the locals.
            They are athletic and energetic sight-hounds that were said to have hunted alongside the Arawak people who were indigenous to the area. Those who have chosen
            to share their home with a Cunucu find them to be tolerant, easy to train, and loyal if a little needy on occasion; this is typically true both of canines 
            brought into the home as puppies and of adult dogs brought in off the streets.

        <h3 id="history">Aruban Cunucu Breed History</h3>
        <p>
            The Arubian Cunucu is a type of dog known as a pariah dog; this means that they are not exactly wild dogs, in that they are descended from domestic animals,
            but most of the dog breeds in this category are free-ranging animals that live on the outskirts of towns and villages. These dogs are essentially feral, and
            their breeding is unrestricted, but certain groups have developed enough similarities to be called a breed in their own right. The pariah dogs in Aruba were
            given the name Cunucu, meaning countryside, because that is where they make their homes, and are believed to be the descendants of Iberian Hounds or Portuguese
            Podengos that were brought to the islands by the Portuguese as early as the sixteenth century, hounds who later bred with local dogs in the area. The Arawak 
            people were said to have employed Cunucu dogs to help them hunt in the rocky interior terrain of the area, mostly frequently for hunting large iguana lizards 
            that live there, and may have bred them specifically for their hunting skills. While the status of the Arubian Cunucu as a distinct breed has not yet been made
            official by an association or kennel club, they are well known on the island of Aruba by native islanders and tourist alike and have developed a distinct 
            physical appearance and temperament. The first dog in space, Laika, was picked up as a stray in Russia, although there is no way to know her heritage for certain,
            many familiar with the Arubian Cunucu believe she was related to this group of dogs.

        <h3 id="temperament">Arubian Cunucu Temperament</h3>
        <p>
            As a rule, Arubian Cunucu's are reported to be very friendly canine towards people, including children and strangers, and feral dogs of this type that live on the 
            streets of Aruba are known to green and sometimes even occupy a few days spending time with accommodating tourists. While these dogs are generally sociable with 
            other dogs, their high prey drive may make them dangerous housemates for cats and small critters, particularly lizards. They are also known as highly intelligent 
            canines, and thos who have rescued a Cunucu indicate that they are easy to train, both as puppies and as adult dogs. They are more emotionally needy than many other
            pariah dog breeds, and can get bored or depressed if left along for too long, but are also extremely adaptable and can live quite peacefully even in small apartments
            as long as they receive enough exercise and attention throughout the day.
