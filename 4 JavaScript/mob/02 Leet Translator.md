# Leet Translator

Let's use [Vue](../docs/Vue.md) to build a [leet speak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet) translator. You can see an example of one [here](https://md5decrypt.net/en/Leet-translator/).

## Version 1

Allow the user to input a message and get the translated message. Substitute numbers for letters.

- a -> 4
- b -> 8
- e -> 3
- g -> 9
- i -> 1
- o -> 0
- s -> 5
- t -> 7

## Version 2 (optional)

Allow the user to also get a more complex translation, e.g. `A` becomes `/-\`. Check out some leet speak translators online for inspiration, [this one](https://www.dcode.fr/leet-speak-1337) has a table.
