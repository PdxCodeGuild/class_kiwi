# Vue Todo

Let's make a todo-list with the following features:

- a text input and button to add an item to the list
- a button on each item to remove the item from the list
- a button on each item to mark the item as completed

Removed items should disappear entirely. Completed items should appear at the bottom (or in a separate list) with a line through them.

## Version 2

Use Bootstrap, Materialize, or custom CSS to make it look beautiful.
