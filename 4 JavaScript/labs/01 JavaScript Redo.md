# Lab 1: JavaScript Redo

## Version 1

Pick a Python lab and re-do it in JavaScript. You should first try to write them using JavaScript's `prompt` and `alert` in place of Python's `input` and `print`.

## Version 2 (optional)

Once you have that working, use `input` and `button` elements, with events. You can read the docs on **DOM Manipulation** and **Events**. You can view a demo [here](https://codepen.io/flux2341/pen/rJpBXe?editors=1010).
